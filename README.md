# beliq-eu shared configuration

Org-wide Renovate presets. Repos reference these instead of duplicating the full policy.

## Presets

- `default.json` (`local>beliq-eu/.github`) — base policy: weekly schedule, dependency
  dashboard, semantic commits, grouped patch and minor updates, one PR per major, security
  alerts labelled and assigned. No auto-merge.
- `automerge.json` (`local>beliq-eu/.github:automerge`) — extends the base and adds
  auto-merge for patch and digest updates (and security updates) once CI passes. Only use
  this in repos that run a check on `pull_request`, otherwise updates merge with no gate.

## Usage

Repo without a PR-triggered CI check:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": ["local>beliq-eu/.github"]
}
```

Repo with a PR-triggered CI check:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": ["local>beliq-eu/.github:automerge"]
}
```

## GitHub Actions policy

Two rules. They apply to `.github/workflows/**` **and** to any `action.yml` this org
publishes, because a `uses:` inside a published composite action runs in the caller's CI,
not ours.

### 1. Pin to a full commit SHA, keep the tag as a trailing comment

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7
```

A tag is mutable: whoever can move `v4` can run their code inside a workflow holding GHCR
push credentials, sibling PATs and deploy access. `default.json` sets `pinDigests` for the
`github-actions` manager so Renovate pins anything new and keeps the digests current.
Scoped to that manager on purpose — a repo-wide `pinDigests` would also freeze the Docker
`:latest` reference that `14-deploy-engine.sh` moves by hand.

### 2. Track the latest major, and never sit on a retired Node runtime

Every JavaScript action declares a `runs.using` runtime, and GitHub retires those on a
schedule: **Node 20 is removed from the runners on 2026-09-23**, and the
`ACTIONS_ALLOW_USE_UNSECURE_NODE_VERSION=true` opt-out is removed with it
([changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-19-deprecation-of-node-20-on-github-actions-runners/)).
A pinned SHA is not protection here: it pins the *code*, and the runtime that code asks for
is what disappears.

So the convention is the latest major of every `actions/*` action, which is also the way to
stay on a current runtime without tracking runtime deprecations per action. Baseline as of
2026-08-31, all `node24`:

| action | major | SHA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `actions/checkout` | v7 | `3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1` |
| `actions/setup-node` | v7 | `820762786026740c76f36085b0efc47a31fe5020` |
| `actions/setup-python` | v7 | `5fda3b95a4ea91299a34e894583c3862153e4b97` |
| `actions/upload-artifact` | v7 | `043fb46d1a93c77aae656e7c1c64a875d1fc6a0a` |
| `actions/cache` | v6 | `55cc8345863c7cc4c66a329aec7e433d2d1c52a9` |

Renovate opens one PR per major (`groupName: null` for majors, deliberately), so majors
arrive as separate PRs and **need merging by hand**. They are the ones that carry the
runtime bump, so an unmerged stack of them is the failure mode this rule exists to catch:
the org sat on `actions/checkout` v7 PRs from 2026-08-17 while the estate stayed on node20.

Node 24 releases of these actions require self-hosted runners at **v2.327.1 or newer**.
Every beliq-eu job runs on `ubuntu-latest`, so this only constrains the `beliq-infra`
self-hosted runner.

### Checking the estate

```bash
# every uses: in the org, with the runtime the pinned SHA actually declares
gh api /repos/beliq-eu/<repo>/contents/<path> -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.raw' \
  | grep -oE 'uses:[[:space:]]*[^[:space:]]+@[^[:space:]]+'
gh api /repos/<action>/contents/action.yml?ref=<sha> -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.raw' \
  | sed -n '/^runs:/,/^[a-z]/p'
```

A `uses:` with no 40-character SHA fails rule 1. A `runs.using` of `node20` fails rule 2.
